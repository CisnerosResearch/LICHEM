### LICHEM: A QMMM interface for polarizable force fields

### Test suite

This directory contains calculations for testing the LICHEM wrappers,
efficiency, and accuracy.

Tests can be performed for pairs of QM and MM wrappers,
```
user:$ ./runtests Ncpus QMPackage MMPackage
```
or all wrappers at once,
```
user:$ ./runtests Ncpus All
```

Additionally, a dry run can be performed to check packages without perfoming
the calculations.
```
user:$ ./runtests Ncpus QMPackage MMPackage Dry
```

If tests are consistently failing, please post details on the GitHub issues
section.

### Notes

The test suite prints run times for the tests. Since LICHEM has different
settings for different wrappers, the times only represent the efficiency of
the wrappers. The run times are not for the comparison of the efficiency of
different packages.

The test suite is not compatable with python 3.0 or higher.
