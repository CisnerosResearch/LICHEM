General:
-Post-HF methods are currently only implemented in PSI4 and semiempirical
methods are currently only implemented in Gaussian.

NWChem interface:
-NWChem calculations can only be performed with DFT. Wavefunction based
methods are not implemented.
-Optimizations with the native NWChem optimizer (Calculation_type: Opt) cannot
be performed. However, optimizations can be performed with the LICHEM
optimizers. Pure QM optimizations within NWChem will be implemented in the
future.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been thoroughly tested in QMMM
simulations.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper is still in the early stages of development.

PIMC:
-NPT Monte Carlo has a volume change bug. This is being investigated, but
NPT MC is low priority.

Manual:
-The theory sections need citations.
-Better descriptions of the simulations methods should be given (i.e. DFP vs
Opt).
-The theory for path-integral calculations needs to be documented.
